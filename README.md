### Accessible Language Learning Platform for Learners with Learning Disabilities
This project involves designing and developing a cloud-based language learning platform specifically tailored to support learners with cognitive, linguistic, or sensory learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, autism spectrum–related processing challenges, or auditory comprehension difficulties. The aim is not to produce a conventional lesson–quiz application, but to engineer a multi-modal instructional environment offering structured reinforcement through text, audio, visual cues, guided pronunciation, and collaborative learning spaces. The platform should in corporate meaningful accessibility and assistive features—such as dyslexia-friendly fonts and contrast themes, text-to-speech and speech-to-text support, adjustable pacing, distraction-free navigation, or layered scaffolding—demonstrating a thoughtful understanding of how software can address learning barriers rather than acting as a superficial checklist implementation. To ensure rigor and depth, the project should incorporate advanced computer science elements such as intelligent recommendation engines, NLP-based automated evaluation of spoken or written responses, distributed real-time collaborative frameworks, or scalable microservices-based architectures. Authenticity is expected through original content design, localization to at least one Indian language where feasible, and justified architectural decisions. The project must demonstrate careful handling of accessibility, inclusivity, user experience, and pedagogical purpose, differentiating itself from generic language learning applications and signalling creativity, technical sophistication, and social relevance.
